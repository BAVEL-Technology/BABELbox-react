# Creating a new game for Babelbox
## Setting up your game
1. Duplicate the "NewGame" folder and rename to something of your choosing
2. Head into your new directory and edit the game.config.js file
    a. Follow along with the comments to create the initial setup of your game
    b. Be sure to include all necessary fields, the comments will mention this
3. Head to the routes directory of your new game and edit line 13 of routes/index.js
    ```
    export const NewGameRoutes = {
    ```
    Change "NewGameRoutes" to whatever you'd like your routes to be called
4. Head to ./src/routes/index.js and import those routes into the app
    ```
    import { NewGameRoutes } from "../games/NewGame/routes"
    ```
    Then spread out those routes into the main routes object
    ```
    ...LiarLiarRoutes,
    ...NewGameRoutes //Add your new routes here
    ```
    This is the last time you need to mess with routing, unless you want to.

5. If you'd like, head to you new games route and create a new portal. You should be taken to a very ugly page that lets you know it worked! Then check out the backend and see if your new portal has been added.

## Building up your game
### You are now ready to build up your game! ðŸš€
* In general, you wont need to make state changes to the gameState. As long as you have updated the database, the sockets are automatically updating the gameState.
* You may need to add some of your own states for a specific component, but that is up to you.
* You can import the BabelBread API wrapper from utils/babelBread.
    * bb().read('portal', {filters})
    * add .first() to get the first item returned of the array
    * bb().edit('portals', {filters}, {keyToChange: whatToChangeItTo})
    * bb().push('portals', {filters}, {arrayToPushTo: whatToPush})
* You can use dot notation to update nested items. If I want to change player 6's name I can do:
    * bb().edit('portals', {code: CODE}, {"params.players.6.name": "Steve"})
* You might need to find the index of a certain user. import { findCurrentUserIndex } from path/to/your/game/utils/currentUserIndex.
    * findCurrentUserIndex(arrayOfPlayers, playerIdInQuestion) will return the index of the player you want
* You may want to move the game into a new phase, adjusting the "set" you are in
    * bb().edit('portals', {code: CODE}, {"params.phase": "newPhase"})
